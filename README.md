# r2s

r2s is a _Text User Interface_ (TUI) for interacting with various aspects of a ROS 2 system.
It is intended as a supplement to the [ros2cli](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli) suite of command line tools.


r2s is written in Python and utilizes [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/) for building the UI.
